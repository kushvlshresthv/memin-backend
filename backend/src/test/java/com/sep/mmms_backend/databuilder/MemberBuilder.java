/*
    A member is associated with memberships, but can reference to unsaved memberships as it has CascadeType.PERSIST, however, the membership must reference valid committee and current member to populate its table

        When saving a member, it tries to save the CommitteeMembershp as well because the memberships field has CascadeType.PERSIST, however, the underlying Committee is not saved because CommitteeMembership>Committee does not have CascadeType.PERSIST. Therefore, the CascadeType.PERSIST only contributes to populating 'role' and 'id', underlying committee and member is not persisted due to memberRepository.save(member)

        Therefore, it is important that the Committeee in the Membership should be properly populated in the Membership, or else we will get an exception that foreign key for Committee is null

    A member is assocated with meetings but meetings can't be saved from Member entity as it doesn't own the relationship nor has CascadeType.PERSIST

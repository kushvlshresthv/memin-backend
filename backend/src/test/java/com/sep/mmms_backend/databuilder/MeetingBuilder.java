/*
    A meeting is associated with a committee and hence must reference a 'SAVED' committee. It populates the join column as it owns the relationship

    A meeting is associated with a coordinator and hence must reference a 'SAVED' coordinator. It populates the join column as it owns the relationship

    A meeting is associated with at least one attendee, and hence must reference a 'SAVED' attendees. It populates join tbale as it owns the relationship

    A meeting is associated with decisions. However, they can reference an unsaved 'DECISION' because meeting has a CascadeType.PERSIST policy for decision.

        The decision must also reference the meeting as decision is the owner of the relationship and requires a meeting reference into order to populate join column
